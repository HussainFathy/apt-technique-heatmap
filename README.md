# APT Techniques Heatmap (MITRE ATT&CK)

This repository contains heatmaps visualizing the techniques used by different APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Layers Included
- **Enterprise ATT&CK**: Techniques used by APT groups targeting enterprise environments.
- **Mobile ATT&CK**: Techniques used by APT groups targeting mobile devices.
- **ICS ATT&CK**: Techniques used by APT groups targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

These heatmaps are generated from MITRE ATT&CK's publicly available data and reflect the frequency of techniques used by different APT groups across the three domains.

## Files
- **`combined_apt_heatmap.json`**: Contains the combined heatmap data for Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS ATT&CK layers.

## Usage
